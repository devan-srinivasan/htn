COMPLETE NOTES:

Practice a question to calculate the volume of gaseous product produced when 5.88 g of sodium bicarbonate is reacted with 25.0 mL of 1.5 M sulfuric acid at SATP. Plan a strategy using knowledge from Units 1-5: Nomenclature, Predicting products, balancing, states, Molar mass, mole ratios, limiting reactant, Concentration (molarity), Pressure, Temperature, Ideal Gas Law.

NOTES THAT USERS PAID HIGH ATTENTION TO:

Mix 25.0 mL of bicarbonate with a volume of the solution to be produced. Use the knowledge to calculate the volume.
